# lvim

This is my personal lunarvim config; it lives in `$HOME/.config/lvim`.

# wtf another vim?

I've used vi and vim for well over 20 years. Like many vim users, I've evolved my config and completely rewritten it many times, including in lua when I switched to neovim.

[LunarVim](https://lunarvim.org) offers a well thought out (but maybe opinionated) config set for the increasing complexity of neovim features that make it much more like an IDE. Keeping up with manual configuration of all the things I want from LSP integration was always a challenge. So far, lunarvim is enjoyable and possible to extend to be very useful.

## Setup

I have always used neovim `HEAD`. So, I am also using lunarvim `nightly`.

This config, or any of its parts, may only work with that combination.

Installation instructions for lunarvim nightly is here: https://www.lunarvim.org/docs/master/installation#nightly
